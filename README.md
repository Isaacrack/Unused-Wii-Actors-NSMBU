# Unused-Wii-Actors-NSMBU
Spritedata for unused Wii actors that crashed because they didn't have models. Made for [Miyamoto Level Editor](https://github.com/aboood40091/Miyamoto).

Put the `patches` folder in `Miyamoto\miyamotodata` and several of those sprites that didn't have **Sprite Images**, will have now.
